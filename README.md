# Xbox-ROS-WSL

A simple way to bypass the need to share USB devices like Xbox controller with Linux in WSL.

- The print_script.py simply writes a single line text file with values of the current state of Xbox.

- The publish_cmd_vel can be run in Linux to publish ROS topic /cmd_vel


I have also included the .exe is that does the same thing as print_script.py

Keep all the files in the same folder.
